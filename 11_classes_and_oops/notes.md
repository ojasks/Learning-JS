# JAVASCRIPT AND CLASSES

Q. Does js have classes ?
A. js is  a rototype based language, and its classes are syntactic sugar(aapko just syntax de diya gaya hai ki aap kuch missout feel na kare ) over prototype based inheritance mechanisims 

# OOP 
it is a programming paradigm

# objects
it is a collection of properties(constants and variables etc) and methods(functions eg - toLowerCase)

# why use OOP
to avoid spaghetti code

# parts of OOP
Object literal  //=> means itself literally
 - constructor function
 - prototypes
 - classes
 - instances

 # 4 pillars of OOPS
 inheritance
 abstraction
 encapsulation
 abstraction
